The title of the Quiz App project is "Math Quiz".

Math Quiz is developed for kids and teenagers to test their basic maths skills and general knowledge.
The app consists of arithmetic questions with multiple choice answers for your child to select.
At the end of each attempt, the result is displayed after the series of questions for feedback.

It is interactive, kid-tested and kid-safe. There are no ads, personal information collection, 
in-app purchases, GPS or location services, or direct internet access from within the app.
No internet connection required to play.

For feedback, contact the developer at johnoluwafemi64@gmail.com.

It is hosted on G-Drive as an apk file at https://drive.google.com/open?id=193KKIkDlDbb6oniNZUIMuVD7jdratMWx
